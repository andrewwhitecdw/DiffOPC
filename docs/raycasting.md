## Need polygon structure

```python
raycasting algorithm
def create_binary_mask(polygons, width, height, device=None):
    """
    Create a binary mask where points inside any of the polygons are marked as 1 and others as 0.

    Args:
        polygons: A list of polygons, where each polygon is represented by its vertex coordinates
                    with shape (n, 2), where n is the number of vertices.
        width: Width of the plane.
        height: Height of the plane.

    Returns:
        A binary mask with shape (height, width), where points inside any of the polygons are marked as 1 and others as 0.

Non-polygon structure,
take out all edges and calculate at once.
